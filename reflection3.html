        <h2>Personal Reflection 3: Social Extended Reality (XR) for Local Community</h2>
        <h3>Project Description and Goal</h3>
        <p>
          Project 3 challenged our group to design a social extended reality (XR) solution to support
          a local community, leveraging XR platforms to address their specific needs. We chose art
          museum visitors (tourists and local residents) as our community, focusing on their desire
          for more interactive and engaging experiences when exploring artworks. Our goal was to empathize with museum visitors’ needs,
          ideate an XR-based solution to enhance their cultural exploration, and prototype an
          interactive mobile application called MuseAR with features like virtual artist avatars,
          time-lapse views, and interactive games . We conducted qualitative user
          evaluations, presented our work in class, and submitted a video demo. My contributions
          included leading the empathy phase, facilitating ideation and brainstorming, and handling
          the presentation and usability testing.
        </p>
        <h3>Learning and Execution Process</h3>
        <h4>1. Empathizing with Users</h4>
        <p>
          I spearheaded the empathy phase to understand the needs of art museum visitors.
          I designed and distributed a Google Form questionnaire to 19 museum visitors at a local art museum,
          asking about their experiences with existing museum guides and their preferences for
          learning about artworks. Key findings revealed that visitors found current materials
          (e.g., PDF guides) text-heavy, hard to access, and lacking engaging context, with a
          preference for hidden stories and artist perspectives.
        </p>
        <p>
          To complement the survey, I conducted a site visit to the Hong Kong Museum of Art,
          shadowing visitors and observing their behaviors. I noted that some googled
          artwork backgrounds on their smartphones, discussed artists’ life stories, and took
          photos, indicating a desire for more interactive and contextual information. I
          documented these observations with notes and photos in a Google Doc, which I
          presented to my group to justify focusing on museum visitors. The unmet need for
          interactive guidance and storytelling solidified our choice, as visitors
          were comfortable using smartphones, making AR a suitable solution.
        </p>
        <h4>2. Ideation and Brainstorming</h4>
        <p>
          I led the ideation phase, facilitating a brainstorming session to develop an XR solution
          for museum visitors. Using a LucidSpark board, we mapped our user pain points (e.g.,
          unengaging text descriptions, insufficient context) and potential XR features.
          Inspired by slide 12’s point of view (POV), I proposed a POV: “Museum visitors need
          immersive, accessible XR tools to deepen their cultural exploration and enhance their
          understanding of artworks.” I suggested features like a “Time-Lapse” view to show artwork
          evolution and an interactive game to spot details, adapting ideas from the survey findings
          about storytelling preferences.
        </p>
        <p>
          We analyzed existing solutions (PDF guides, audio guides, online searches) and their pros
          and cons, concluding that XR offered superior interactivity and immersion. My groupmate
          sketched a storyboard of a visitor, Maya, using an XR app to explore an artwork’s hidden
          story via a virtual artist avatar, which we speed-dated with peers. Feedback praised the
          immersive concept but suggested clearer instructions for XR interactions, shaping our
          final proposal for MuseAR. At last, we prioritized features like “Masterpiece Mystery”
          and “Art Aging” to meet visitors’ needs for engagement and storytelling.
        </p>
        <h4>3. Prototyping</h4>
        <p>
          While I didn’t lead the prototyping, my groupmates developed the prototype using Figma
          and Unity, implementing four main features: “Masterpiece Mystery” (virtual avatar and game)
          , “Art Around” (360-degree rotation), “Viewer Voice” (comment board), and “Art Aging”
          (time-lapse view). My empathy work ensured the prototype prioritized storytelling and
          interactivity, with QR codes for easy access.
        </p>
        <h4>4. Presentation and Usability Testing</h4>
        <p>
          I was responsible for the in-class presentation and usability testing. For the presentation,
          I organized our slides to cover our process: empathy findings, POV, ideation, prototype
          features, and user feedback. My groupmate narrated the video demo, showcasing a
          user accessing MuseAR via a QR code to explore a painting’s time-lapse and leave a comment
          on the “Viewer Voice” board. I emphasized how MuseAR addressed user needs for
          immersive storytelling, citing survey data (e.g., visitors wanting hidden stories) and site
          visit observations.
        </p>
        <p>
          For usability testing, I conducted qualitative evaluations with some HKUST students I asked:
          “How helpful was the virtual artist compared to PDF guides?” and “Did the time-lapse view
          add value to your experience?” Feedback praised “Masterpiece Mystery” for being engaging
          and less wordy, though users noted unclear instructions for “Art Around” zoom controls.
          The “Viewer Voice” board was appreciated for interactivity but raised concerns about
          comment clutter. Lastly, we summarize the insights in our presentation and sharing them
          with my group to propose improvements like clearer UI instructions and comment moderation.
        </p>
        <h3>Personal Reflection</h3>
        <p>
          This project allow me to know the challenges museum visitors face with unengaging and inaccessible
          materials, which I hadn’t fully appreciated before. Leading the empathy phase was rewarding;
          designing the questionnaire and conducting site visits taught me to translate real-world
          observations into actionable design insights. The site visit, in particular, visitors google
          artwork details highlighted their hunger for deeper context, which XR could uniquely satisfy.
        </p>
        <p>
          Facilitating ideation stretched my creative and leadership skills. Guiding the group to align
          on MuseAR’s features while incorporating peer feedback from speed dating was challenging but
          taught me the value of iterative refinement. Presenting and conducting usability testing were
          highlights; hearing users describe the time-lapse as “fun” and “must-have” validated our
          approach, though addressing headset discomfort and UI clarity showed me the importance of
          practical design considerations.
        </p>
        <p>
          I used AI tools minimally, leveraging ChatGPT to draft initial questionnaire questions,
          which I refined based on museum context. Compared to Project 2, I leaned more into qualitative
          research and group facilitation, which boosted my confidence in user-centered design.
          Next time, I’d dive into prototyping tools like Figma to contribute technically and ensure
          tighter integration between empathy and implementation. This project inspired me to keep
          exploring XR’s potential to make cultural experiences more immersive and inclusive.
