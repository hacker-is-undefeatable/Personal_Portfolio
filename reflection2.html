                <h2>Personal Reflection 2: Human-Robot Interaction for Hospitality</h2>
                <h3>Project Description and Goal</h3>
                <p>
                    Project 2 challenged us to design a human-robot interaction (HRI) solution, specifically a voice
                    agent or chatbot, to enhance hospitality services for a specific user group. Our group focused on
                    new immigrants from Mainland China arriving in Hong Kong aged 18-35. The goal was to empathize with
                    their needs, ideate a practical solution and prototype a working chatbot to assist them in a
                    hospitality scenario such as ordering at a local tea cafe, while also addressing broader cultural
                    and social integration challenges. We aimed to create a web application with a chatbot, forum and
                    activity features. Also, we do usability testing in a video demo and a class presentation.
                </p>
                <h3>Learning and Execution Process</h3>
                <h4>1. Empathizing with Users</h4>
                    <p>
                        We took the lead in researching the experiences of new immigrants in Hong Kong, focusing on
                        their challenges with Cantonese, cultural adaptation and daily interactions. My groupmate
                        interviewed a
                        friend who recently moved from Shanghai to HKUST, asking about her struggles with ordering food
                        in Cantonese. Her insights about not understanding HK slang and feeling isolated in group chats
                        inspired us to propose the tea cafe scenario.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I also walked around Mong Kok and Causeway Bay, observing how newcomers interacted with local
                        cafes and noting their hesitation when ordering. I documented these observations with photos
                        and notes in a Google Doc, which I shared with my group to ground our empathy phase in
                        real-world evidence.
                    </p>
                <h4>2. Ideation and Brainstorming</h4>
                    <p>
                        During our group brainstorming session, I suggested we focus on a hospitality scenario where
                        language barriers are immediate and tangible—ordering at a tea cafe. We used Miro to construct
                        a point of view (POV): “New immigrants need a Cantonese learning tool for daily communication.”
                        My groupmate contributed by sketching a storyboard of a user arriving at a cafe, struggling to
                        order, and using our chatbot to learn phrases like “ngo yiu yum bui cha” (I want a cup of tea).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My groupmates also proposed integrating cultural guidance (e.g., slang explainers) into the
                        chatbot, drawing from our observations. We speed-dated our ideas with peers, and our tea cafe
                        scenario received positive feedback for its practicality, helping us narrow our focus.
                    </p>
                <h4>3. Prototyping</h4>
                    <p>
                        I was responsible for designing the chatbot’s conversational flow and building a working
                        prototype. Using Streamlit, I created a system that responds to queries like “How do I order
                        milk tea in Cantonese?” with text and audio output. I programmed the chatbot to handle not just
                        cafe-related questions, like ordering food, menu inquiries and basic phrase learning, but also
                        broader topics about HK culture and Cantonese, addressing any user questions in these areas. I
                        also added a feature to recommend activities tailored to users’ interests, pulling data from a
                        personal information form they fill out at login. Adding audio was vital, as the PDF highlighted
                        Cantonese as a major barrier for new immigrants. For the audio, I integrated the Google
                        Text-to-Speech API to generate Cantonese phrases (e.g., “ngo yiu yat bui nai cha” for “I want a
                        cup of milk tea”), which saved time and ensured clarity. Beyond functionality, I taught myself
                        to design a strong interface with Streamlit, prioritizing clean layouts and intuitive navigation
                        to ensure the chatbot was easy to use. I rigorously tested the prototype, fine-tuning it for
                        reliable, accurate responses across all features and prepared it for integration into the
                        group’s web application.
                    </p>
                <p>
                    I also built the login system for the chatbot using Supabase, enabling secure storage and management
                    of user data. With Supabase, I set up a backend to handle authentication and store information from
                    the personal information form users complete at login, such as their interests and preferences.
                    This allowed the chatbot to personalize activity recommendations and tailor responses based on
                    individual profiles. Learning to integrate Supabase with Streamlit was a new challenge for me,
                    but it paid off by making the user experience more dynamic and relevant. I tested the system to
                    ensure data was saved accurately and retrieved smoothly, enhancing the chatbot’s overall
                    functionality.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Additionally, I created a calendar feature within the prototype, letting users enter details for
                    their own events. Using Streamlit’s interactive components, I designed a simple form where users
                    can input event names, dates and descriptions, which are then displayed in a clean, organized
                    calendar view. I linked this to the Supabase database to store event data persistently, tying it
                    to each user’s account so they could track their plans—like attending a recommended activity or
                    a personal outing. This required me to learn how to manage date inputs and render them effectively
                    in the interface. After some trial and error, I got it working seamlessly, adding practical value
                    for new immigrants adjusting to life in Hong Kong.
                </p>
                <h4>4. Presentation and Usability Testing</h4>
                <p>
                    For the in-class presentation, I focused on showcasing the features of my prototype, walking the
                    audience through the chatbot’s conversational flow, the Supabase login system, and the calendar
                    functionality. I explained how the chatbot handles cafe-related queries like “How do I order milk
                    tea in Cantonese?” using Google Text-to-Speech for audio and expands to answer questions about HK
                    culture and Cantonese, while also recommending personalized activities based on user login data.
                    I highlighted the Streamlit interface I designed and how the calendar allows users manage their
                    events.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My groupmate took charge of the usability testing, conducting it with 2 HKUST students and recording
                    a video demo. While I didn’t run the testing myself, I was glad to see my prototype hold up in
                    action and appreciated how the feedback validated its core features.
                </p>
                <h3>Personal Reflection</h3>
                <p>
                    This project opened my eyes to the real struggles new immigrants face in Hong Kong, like mastering
                    Cantonese and adapting to a new culture, which I hadn’t fully appreciated before. Building the
                    chatbot’s conversational flow with Streamlit was both challenging and rewarding, also pushed me
                    to think broadly about user needs. Integrating the Google Text-to-Speech API was a smart workaround
                    for audio and it taught me how to leverage external tools effectively.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Adding the Supabase login system and calendar feature deepened my technical skills, connecting a
                    database to Streamlit was tricky at first, but troubleshooting authentication and data storage gave
                    me a confidence boost. The calendar, in particular, felt like a personal win; seeing it display
                    user events smoothly after wrestling with date inputs was satisfying. I learned to balance
                    functionality with practicality, some early ideas (like overly complex personalization) had to be
                    scaled back to keep the prototype reliable.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This experience sharpened my problem-solving and made me more empathetic to newcomers’ challenges.
                    I contributed the core interactive pieces, the chatbot, login and calendar, which felt like the
                    backbone of our solution and seeing them come together in the group’s web app was motivating. I’d
                    love to explore more advanced features next time, like real-time speech input and apply this
                    user-focused mindset to other contexts.
                </p>
