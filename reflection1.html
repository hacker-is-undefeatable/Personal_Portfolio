                <h2>Personal Reflection 1: Designing an Animal-Friendly HKUST for Sloths</h2>
                <h3>Project Description and Goal</h3>
                <p>
                    This project tasked us with imagining HKUST as a campus welcoming visiting students from the animal
                    kingdom, specifically focusing on sloths as an extreme case study. The goal was to identify
                    potential user characteristics, needs and obstacles these animal students might face on campus,
                    and propose solutions to make HKUST more accessible and friendly for them. Through ideation and
                    brainstorming, we aimed to empathize with these unique newcomers, document challenges via a mindmap
                    and present our ideas during our group presentation.
                </p>
                <h3>Learning and Execution Process</h3>
                <h4>1. Researching</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                    I began by researching sloth behaviors, abilities and habits, such as their slow movement, poor
                    eyesight, preference for hanging and resting in trees and need for quiet, warm environments. I
                    interviewed peers at HKUST to understand common challenges faced by newcomers (e.g., navigation
                    issues, accessibility barriers and classroom accommodations) and extrapolated these to sloths.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                    I created sketches and notes during interviews, which I later organized into a Word file. I also
                    go around campus areas (like staircases, lecture halls and classrooms) to visualize potential sloth
                    challenges, such as inaccessible stairs or fast-paced lecture environments.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h4>2. Ideation and Brainstorming</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                    During the in-class session, I collaborated with my group to combine sloth characteristics with
                    HKUST’s existing infrastructure. We identified four key areas: Campus Navigation, Lecture & Learning
                    Experience, Food & Environment, and Social Integration. Using a whiteboard and sticky notes,
                    we mapped out potential problems (e.g., sloths struggling with stairs, needing tree-like resting
                    spaces) and corresponding needs (e.g., tactile navigation aids, AI-assisted note-taking).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        I contributed to creating the mindmap, using a tool called Miro to visually organize our ideas. The
                        mindmap served as a  structured representation of our brainstorming, and also branch into categories
                        and sub-issues/solutions.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h4>3. Group Presentation</h4>
                <p>
                    For the presentation, my groupmate helped prepare a quick overview of our mindmap, focusing on a
                    specific user scenario: a sloth student navigating HKUST’s campus. Also, we show a GIF of a sloth
                    moving slowly to illustrate the challenges and proposed solutions like “slow lanes” and
                    “hanging-friendly classrooms.
                </p>
                <h3>Personal Reflection</h3>
                <p>
                    This project deepened my understanding of empathy-driven design, particularly for non-human users.
                    I learned about sloth biology and behavior, as well as how to apply universal design principles to
                    extreme cases. I also improved my skills in mindmapping, presentation design and collaborative
                    brainstorming, recognizing the value of structured documentation (e.g., mindmaps, photos, videos)
                    in problem-solving.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I realized the importance of balancing creativity with practicality—while sloth accommodations like
                    “artificial hanging zones” are imaginative, they must align with campus feasibility. I also learned
                    to manage time effectively during interviews and ideation, ensuring we captured diverse perspectives
                    without overwhelming our process.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This experience boosted my confidence in leading group projects and sharpened my critical thinking
                    for unconventional problems, particularly when addressing unconventional and complex problems. I’m
                    excited to apply critical thinking to later projects, enabling me to tackle different problems in
                    varied contexts with deeper insight and innovative problem-solving.
